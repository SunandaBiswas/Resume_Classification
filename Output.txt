CADEMIC RESEARCH
 
Estimation of air pollutants emissions in Bangladesh using Machine 
Learning
 
Worked on developing Univariate time series forecasting model using MLP 
and LSTM architecture for estimation of different types of air pollutants 
emissions in Bangladesh that are i
ndicators of the climate change of 
Bangladesh.
 
Multi
